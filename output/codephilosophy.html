    <p>John Ousterhout's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-John-Ousterhout/dp/1732102201">A Philosophy of Software Design</a> is a masterpiece of software engineering wisdom. Here are some of the most impactful quotes from the book, organized by theme.</p>
<h4>Complexity</h4>
<p>Complexity is the heart of most software engineering challenges.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understanding Complexity</strong>: "If a software system is hard to understand and modify, then it is complicated; if it is easy to understand and modify, then it is simple."</li>
<li><strong>Change Amplification</strong>: "The first symptom of complexity is that a seemingly simple change requires code modifications in many different places."</li>
<li><strong>Cognitive Load</strong>: "The second symptom of complexity is cognitive load, which refers to how much a developer needs to know in order to complete a task."</li>
<li><strong>Incremental Complexity</strong>: "Complexity is incremental: you have to sweat the small stuff."</li>
<li><strong>Accumulating Complexity</strong>: "Over time, complexity accumulates, and it becomes harder and harder for programmers to keep all of the relevant factors in their minds as they modify the system."</li>
</ul>
<h4>Code Design</h4>
<p>Good design is all about making the right tradeoffs and choosing the appropriate abstractions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong>: "It’s more important for a module to have a simple interface than a simple implementation."</li>
<li><strong>Write Twice; Commit Once</strong>: "Designing software is hard, so it’s unlikely that your first thoughts about how to structure a module or system will produce the best design."</li>
<li><strong>Abstractions</strong>: "When designing methods, the most important goal is to provide clean and simple abstractions."</li>
<li><strong>Deep Modules</strong>: "The best modules are deep: they have a lot of functionality hidden behind a simple interface."</li>
<li><strong>Information Hiding</strong>: "Information hiding makes it easier to evolve the system."</li>
<li><strong>Avoiding Config Parameters</strong>: "You should avoid configuration parameters as much as possible."</li>
</ul>
<h4>DX (Developer Experience)</h4>
<p>The humans in the software development loop are just as important as the "loops" themselves.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimize for Legibility</strong>: "Software should be designed for ease of reading, not ease of writing."</li>
<li><strong>Reduce Suffering</strong>: "Most modules have more users than developers, so it is better for the developers to suffer than the users."</li>
<li><strong>Comments and Clarity</strong>: "The guiding principle for comments is that comments should describe things that aren’t obvious from the code."</li>
<li><strong>Obviousness in Code</strong>: "If someone reading your code says it’s not obvious, then it’s not obvious, no matter how clear it may seem to you."</li>
<li><strong>Choosing Good Names</strong>: "Choosing a mediocre name for a particular variable... will have a significant impact on complexity and manageability."</li>
</ul>
<p>Taken together all of these quotes stress that software is as much about managing complexity as it is about writing code.</p>
