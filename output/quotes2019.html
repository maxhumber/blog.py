<blockquote>
<p>I remember, as a kid, when I first understood that only half of every tree is visible, that the roots in the soil are equal to the branches in the sky, that a whole other half is underground. It took me a lot longer, well into adulthood, to realize people are like that too.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Potential is a foul fucking temptation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—Matt Goldman in <em>Gone to Dust</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not always possible to restore one's boundaries after they have been blurred and made permeable by a relationship: try as we might, we cannot reconstitute ourselves as the autonomous beings we previously imagined ourselves to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—Mohsin Hamid in <em>The Reluctant Fundamentalist</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>You need to come face-to-face with the past, not as some naive, easily wounded boy, but as a grown-up, independent professional. Not to see what you want to see, but what you must see. Otherwise, you’ll carry around that baggage for the rest of your life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—Haruki Murakami in <em>Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Four things do not come back: the spoken word, the sped arrow, the past life, and the neglected opportunity.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>—Yuval Noah Harari in <em>21 Lessons for the 21st Century</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The future is less a noun than a verb, a thing we do.</p>

<p>If you think anyone is sane you just don’t know enough about them. The key — and this is very relevant in our case — is to find someone whose insanity dovetails with your own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—Christopher Moore in <em>The Stupidest Angel</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two people should see a relationship as a constant opportunity to improve and be improved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—The School of Life in <em>An Emotional Education</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn not thine eyes, but love the one thou’rt with.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—Ian Doescher as William Shakespeare in <em>Get Thee Back to the Future!</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cause none of us is just the numbers on the back of our baseball cards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—Rich Cohen in <em>The Chicago Cubs</em></p>
