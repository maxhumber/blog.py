<p>The more choices there are, the more you expect to find a perfect fit; yet, at the same time, the larger the array, the less likely it becomes that you picked the best item.</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>— Alain de Botton in How Proust Can Change Your Life</p>

<p>The path to happiness in a relationship is not just about finding someone who you think is going to make you happy. Rather, the reverse is equally true: the path to happiness is about finding someone who you want to make happy, someone whose happiness is worth devoting yourself to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Clayton Christensen in How Will You Measure Your Life?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No more be griev'd at that which thou hast done: Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud: Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun, And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud. All men make faults, and even I in this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— William Shakespeare in Sonnets, 35</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Am I free to change my mind? Of course not. It can only change me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Sam Harris in The Moral Landscape</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mud huts, penthouses and the Champs-Elysées don’t really determine our mood. Serotonin does.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Yuval Noah Harari in Sapiens</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our dissatisfactions may be the result of failing to look properly at our lives rather than the result of anything inherently deficient about them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Alain de Botton in How Proust Can Change Your Life</p>

<p>I can calculate the motions of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Isaac Newton in Fortune's Formula by William Poundstone</p>

</blockquote>
<p>— David Buss in The Evolution of Desire</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’ve got to find the right person. And you have to be the right person.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Duana Welch in Love Factually</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would help us pay more attention to things, lovers in particular. Deprivation quickly drives us into a process of appreciation, which is not to say that we have to be deprived in order to appreciate things, but rather that we should learn a lesson from what we naturally do when we lack something, and apply it to conditions where we don’t.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Alain de Botton in How Proust Can Change Your Life</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The final moment of success is often no more thrilling than the relief of taking off a heavy backpack at the end of a long hike. If you went on the hike only to feel that pleasure, you are a fool.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Jonathan Haidt in The Happiness Hypothesis</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hell is other people. But so is heaven.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Jonathan Haidt in The Happiness Hypothesis</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s a thing I believe about people my age: we are the children of Hogwarts, and more than anything, we just want to be sorted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Robin Sloan in Sourdough</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People are wired to need other people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Duana Welch in Love Factually</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I look back on my own life, I recognize that some of the greatest gifts I received from my parents stemmed not from what they did for me—but rather from what they didn’t do for me.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>— Albert Camus in We Need to Talk by Celeste Headlee</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Success in America doesn't require any special talent or any kind of extra effort. You just have to be consistent and not fuck up. That's how most people fail. They can't stand the pressure of getting what they want, so when they see that they are getting close they engineer some sort of fuckup to undermine their success.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Christopher Moore in Island of the Sequined Love Nun</p>

</blockquote>
<p>— Milo Yiannopoulos in Dangerous</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Much literature and drama would conceivably have proved entirely unengaging, would have said nothing to us had we first encountered its subject matter over breakfast in the form of a news-in-brief. "Tragic end for Verona lovebirds: after mistakenly thinking his sweetheart dead, a young man took his life. Having discovered the fate of her lover, the woman killed herself in turn."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Alain de Botton in How Proust Can Change Your Life</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we love, we always strive to become better than we are. When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Paulo Coelho in The Alchemist</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our understanding of love has been hijacked and beguiled by its first distractingly moving moments. We have allowed our love stories to end way too early.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Alain de Botton in The Course of Love</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s nothing like doing something wrong to spur other people into doing it correctly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Matt Parker in Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension</p>
<h4>Level: macro</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>If it’s in the news, don’t worry about it. The very definition of news is ‘something that hardly ever happens.'</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Enjoyable as it might be while it lasts, it probably goes without saying that the life of a mere consumer lacks any real meaning and purpose.</p>

<p>— Douglas Murray in The Strange Death of Europe</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas religion asks us to believe in something, money asks us to believe that other people believe in something.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Active investing is a zero-sum game. The only way for one active investor to do better than average is for another active investor to do worse than average.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— William Poundstone in Fortune's Formula</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modern business-people and lawyers are, in fact, powerful sorcerers. The principal difference between them and tribal shamans is that modern lawyers tell far stranger tales.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Yuval Noah Harari in Sapiens</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will embarrass our descendants, just as our ancestors embarrass us. This is moral progress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Sam Harris in The Moral Landscape</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A culture and a society are not things run for the convenience of the people who happen to be here right now, but a deep pact between the dead, the living and those yet to be born.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Douglas Murray in The Strange Death of Europe</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without appropriation, culture as we know it would not exist. Civilization would resemble a Nickelback album.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Milo Yiannopoulos in Dangerous</p>
<blockquote>
<p>only infrmatn esentil to understandn mst b tranmitd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Ali Almossawi in Bad Choices</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Giving a superintelligence a single open-ended goal with no constraints can therefore be dangerous: if we create a superintelligence whose only goal is to play the game Go as well as possible, the rational thing for it to do is to rearrange our Solar System into a gigantic computer without regard for its previous inhabitants and then start settling our cosmos on a quest for more computational power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Max Tegmark in Life 3.0</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will soon be looking at hordes of citizens of zero economic value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Thomas Davenport in Only Humans Need Apply</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Ninety-five percent of all the species that have ever existed are now extinct, so don’t look so goddamn smug.</p>
