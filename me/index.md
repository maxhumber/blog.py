# Work
I do data science for a company called [Borrowell](http://borrowell.com/). We are a fintech lender that does low-interest personal loans for people who want better alternatives to expensive credit card debt. We are backed by a number of investors including: Equitable Bank, Power Financial, Freycinet, Oakwest, and Hedgewood.

# Stack
I mostly lean on R and Python and absolutely I love the *tidyverse* and Stan/PyMC3.
