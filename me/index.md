# work ðŸ’¸

I do data science for [Borrowell](http://borrowell.com/). We are a fintech lender that does low-interest personal loans for people who want better alternatives to expensive credit card debt. We are backed by a number of investors including: Equitable Bank, Power Financial, Oakwest, and Hedgewood.

I mostly lean on R/Python and absolutely I love the *tidyverse* and Stan.
