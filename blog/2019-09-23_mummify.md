mummify just earned it's [**1.0**](https://pypi.org/project/mummify/1.0/) release!

It's kind of scary to kick software out of *0.x* and label it "production ready". But after using it for a year, it feels ready...

#### Origin

I started writing mummify in early 2018 and debuted it at AnacondaCON that year in a talk titled ['Data Engineering for Data Scientists'](https://github.com/maxhumber/presentations/tree/master/2018-04-09_data_engineering). Though the presentation was mostly tongue-in-cheek, the talk and the package was well received.

Since then I've used mummify in several machine learning projects and have heard from several more people who use it regularly.

#### About

What is mummify? [mummify is git + logging for ML](https://github.com/maxhumber/mummify)...

Basically, the package takes care of git and logging for your machine learning project so that you can focus on what's important.

#### Usage

mummify is dead simple to use. Just import it at the top and add `mummify.log(<string>)` at the bottom:

```python
import mummify

...

model = KNeighborsClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)

...

mummify.log(f'Test Accuracy: {accuracy}')
```

When enabled mummify will save model snapshots and log performance after each run.

#### New

What's new in 1.0? Honestly, nothing. Though I rewrote the entire backend to leverage `subprocess.run` instead of older functions, the API remains the same.
