    <p>Another year, another 52 books! Overall, 2024 was a so-so year in reading for me—a couple good books and a bunch of bad ones (my average rating on Goodreads was a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2024/16626766">3.3</a>). The new Robin Sloan release was especially disappointing and has kinda put me off his entire back catalog. Here's what I might recommend reading instead:</p>
<h3>Favourite Books of 2024</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1668069539"><em>The Courage to Be Disliked</em></a> by Ichiro Kishimi</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/0593728483"><em>Unruly: The Ridiculous History of England's Kings and Queens</em></a> by David Mitchell</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1641296283"><em>Red Side Story</em></a> by Jasper Fforde</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1473613574"><em>Venomous Lumpsucker</em></a> by Ned Beauman</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/0806541229"><em>You Can Negotiate Anything</em></a> by Herb Cohen</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dog Books</h3>
<p>My wife and I welcomed a new puppy into our lives earlier this year. To prepare, I read seven different "dog" books, and I think she read another five? There's a mountain of wildly conflicting advice out there, but Steve Mann's <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1788701607"><em>Easy Peasy Puppy Squeezy</em></a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1788703413"><em>Easy Peasy Doggy Squeezy</em></a> helped a lot.</p>
<h3>52x10</h3>
<p>This year marks the 10th time that I've hit 52 books (or more). I think it might be time to start rereading some? Starting with a few favourites from 2015:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1594632332"><em>How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia</em></a> by Mohsin Hamid</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1451636024"><em>Waking Up</em></a> by Sam Harris</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B074J77XWL"><em>Flatland</em></a> by Edwin A. Abbott</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0071VOLN8"><em>The Fish That Ate the Whale</em></a> by Rich Cohen</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00INIXQA2"><em>How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life</em></a> by Russ Roberts</li>
</ul>
<p>Really curious and excited to see how I'll feel about them a decade later...</p>
<h3>How I Read So Much</h3>
<p>People always ask how I read so much... honestly, it's not <em>that</em> hard: no phones in bed and about 45–60 minutes of reading each night. Sure, I "cheat" with some audio books on Libby (about 10-15 per year), but there's a lot of evidence to suggest that <a href="https://time.com/5388681/audiobooks-reading-books/">listening is just as good as reading</a>. </p>
<h3>Challenge Habits</h3>
<p>Keeping up with the 52-challenge for a decade now has definitely forced some <em>interesting</em> habits. On the one hand, I'll ditch books earlier than most. On the other, I often force myself to slog through a garbage book because I'm too deep and need it for the count. Also, I tend to avoid books over 350 pages. And to maintain momentum, I usually juggle 2-3 books at a time (once I’m 90% done one, I’ll start the next).</p>
<h3>Quote Ritual</h3>
<p>Every year I collect about 1000 highlights from my Kindle. It's become something of a ritual to export these quotes, manually go through each in a system of multiple passes, curate the best, and paraphrase the remainder into ideas that I hope to remember into the next year. If you’re curious, <a href="https://maxhumber.com/quotes2024">here are my quotes for 2024</a>.</p>
