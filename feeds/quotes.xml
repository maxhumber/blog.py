&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best ideas from all the books I read in 2023:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
 &lt;summary&gt;Expectations before happiness.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"Your happiness depends on your expectations more than anything else."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Morgan Housel (Same as Ever)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
 &lt;summary&gt;A good hobby should be a little embarrassing.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"A good hobby probably should feel a little embarrassing; that's a sign you're doing it for its own sake, rather than for some socially sanctioned outcome."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Oliver Burkeman (Four Thousand Weeks)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
 &lt;summary&gt;A life without problems (to solve) is meaningless.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"The state of having no problems is obviously never going to arrive. And more to the point, you wouldn't want it to, because a life devoid of all problems would contain nothing worth doing, and would therefore be meaningless."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Oliver Burkeman (Four Thousand Weeks)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
 &lt;summary&gt;It's surprisingly easy to create problems when trying to solve problems.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"I'm more interested in questions like, When you make progress against an individual problem do you create additional problems? What are those additional problems, and are those new problems bigger, the same as, or less than the problems you've just solved?"&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Alain de Botton (Do Humankind's Best Days Lie Ahead?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
 &lt;summary&gt;Some problems become even worse when you try to eliminate them.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"What's easy to miss is that there are bad things that become bigger problems when you try to eliminate them. I think the most successful people recognize when a certain amount of acceptance beats purity."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Morgan Housel (Same as Ever)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
 &lt;summary&gt;Your job is to reduce stress.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"This is one of the most valuable reframes in the book. Usual Frame: Stress comes with the job. Reframe: Reducing stress IS your job. We work for a variety of reasons, but work is only one part of a larger system for reducing stress. I don't earn money just to have it. I earn money to make my life more pleasant, which includes reducing my stress about surviving."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Scott Adams (Reframe Your Brain)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
 &lt;summary&gt;You gotta tolerate some bullshit if you want to get ahead.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"A unique skill, an underrated skill, is identifying the optimal amount of hassle and nonsense you should put up with to get ahead while getting along. Franklin Roosevelt—the most powerful man in the world, whose paralysis meant his aides often had to carry him to the bathroom—once said, 'If you can't use your legs and they bring you milk when you wanted orange juice, you learn to say 'that's all right,' and drink it.' Every industry and career is different, but there's universal value in accepting hassle when reality demands it."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Morgan Housel (Same as Ever)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
 &lt;summary&gt;It's okay to strategically underachieve.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"You'll inevitably end up underachieving at something, simply because your time and energy are finite. But the great benefit of strategic underachievement—that is, nominating in advance whole areas of life in which you won't expect excellence of yourself—is that you focus that time and energy more effectively."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Oliver Burkeman (Four Thousand Weeks)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
 &lt;summary&gt;Stay on the fucking bus.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"The final principle is that, more often than not, originality lies on the far side of unoriginality. The Finnish American photographer Arno Minkkinen dramatizes this deep truth about the power of patience with a parable about Helsinki's main bus station. There are two dozen platforms there, he explains, with several different bus lines departing from each one—and for the first part of its journey, each bus leaving from any given platform takes the same route through the city as all the others, making identical stops. Think of each stop as representing one year of your career, Minkkinen advises photography students. You pick an artistic direction—perhaps you start working on platinum studies of nudes—and you begin to accumulate a portfolio of work. Three years (or bus stops) later, you proudly present it to the owner of a gallery. But you're dismayed to be told that your pictures aren't as original as you thought, because they look like knockoffs of the work of the photographer Irving Penn; Penn's bus, it turns out, had been on the same route as yours. Annoyed at yourself for having wasted three years following somebody else's path, you jump off that bus, hail a taxi, and return to where you started at the bus station. This time, you board a different bus, choosing a different genre of photography in which to specialize. But a few stops later, the same thing happens: you're informed that your new body of work seems derivative, too. Back you go to the bus station. But the pattern keeps on repeating: nothing you produce ever gets recognized as being truly your own. What's the solution? 'It's simple,' Minkkinen says. 'Stay on the bus. Stay on the fucking bus.' A little farther out on their journeys through the city, Helsinki's bus routes diverge, plunging off to unique destinations as they head through the suburbs and into the countryside beyond. That's where the distinctive work begins. But it begins at all only for those who can muster the patience to immerse themselves in the earlier stage—the trial-and-error phase of copying others, learning new skills, and accumulating experience."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Oliver Burkeman (Four Thousand Weeks)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
 &lt;summary&gt;Maximize connections over specific connections.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"Usual Frame: Success depends on who you know. Reframe: Success depends on how many people you know."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Scott Adams (Reframe Your Brain)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
 &lt;summary&gt;Take the 10x/0x bet over the 1.10x bet (some of the time).&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"'[The EA executive] said, 'Why would I give you a dollar knowing I'm gonna get $1.10 back when I can give Chris $10 million and either make $100 million or get a tax write-off?''"&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Jason Schreier (Press Reset)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
 &lt;summary&gt;The digital economy has no need for "second-best".&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"'Rightfully so, rightfully so. Thus, from that we can conclude even if it were only minimally worse, there would be no reason to use the second-best search engine. Winner takes it all. Loser gets nothing. In the digital economy, nobody needs the second-best product, the second-best provider, the second-best social network, the second-best shop, the second-best comedian, the second-best singer. It's a superstar economy. Long live the superstar, fuck the rest.'"&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Marc-Uwe Kling (Qualityland)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
 &lt;summary&gt;Blockbuster didn't respect or learn from their competitors.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"Respect and Learn from Competitors. This is obvious to anyone who has ever been in a competitive retail business, but it was never a part of Blockbuster's DNA."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Alan Payne (Built to Fail)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
 &lt;summary&gt;Don't neglect risk by omission.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"'Aunt Minnie has died and left each of you $100,000. You have an investment choice to make. You can invest it all at 7 percent for five years, or you can invest it at 7.5 percent for ten years.' After they had time to reflect, they unanimously chose 7 percent for five years. When I asked them what risk they'd undertaken with this decision, they said, 'None.' Their justification was that by staying short, future inflation wouldn't erode their returns as much as the longer term, and they'd have optionality after the five years. But they were missing the reinvestment risk. They were so focused on what would happen during the investment period, they neglected to look beyond the five years. Not a problem if rates stayed at 7 percent or higher. But if they dropped? Problem. Once the [MBA] students understood there is risk by omission as well as by commission, my objective was accomplished."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;

  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Sam Zell (Am I Being Too Subtle?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
 &lt;summary&gt;There's opportunity in the gap between supply and demand.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"Opportunity is very often embedded in the imbalance between supply and demand. It could be rising demand against flat or diminishing supply, or flat demand against shrinking supply."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Sam Zell (Am I Being Too Subtle?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
 &lt;summary&gt;Want to understand someone? Follow the money.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"Usual Frame: Predicting people's actions involves many variables. Reframe: Follow the money. That's all you need."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Scott Adams (Reframe Your Brain)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
 &lt;summary&gt;Good motives don't always generate good results.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"Yet the best motives do not always generate the best results. As experience amply demonstrates, a never-ending ethnic preference program that accentuates ethnic distinctions is likely to achieve the opposite of its intended results."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Jens Heycke (Out of the Melting Pot, Into the Fire)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
 &lt;summary&gt;Perfectionism is dangerous.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"I think many of the worst movements in history have been born out of the minds of people who believed in perfectionism — scientists, politicians, and others who thought that we could straighten things out, once and for all."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Rudyard Griffths (Do Humankind's Best Days Lie Ahead?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
 &lt;summary&gt;No groups = no group conflict.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"It is an inescapable truism: without groups, there can be no group conflict."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Jens Heycke (Out of the Melting Pot, Into the Fire)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
 &lt;summary&gt;To lie is to deny others access to reality.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"By lying, we deny our friends access to reality—and their resulting ignorance often harms them in ways we did not anticipate."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Sam Harris (Lying)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
 &lt;summary&gt;A simple interface is better than a simple implementation.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"It's more important for a module to have a simple interface than a simple implementation."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— John Ousterhout (A Philosophy of Software Design)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
 &lt;summary&gt;Write twice. Commit once.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"Designing software is hard, so it's unlikely that your first thoughts about how to structure a module or system will produce the best design. You'll end up with a much better result if you consider multiple options for each major design decision: design it twice."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— John Ousterhout (A Philosophy of Software Design)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
 &lt;summary&gt;If you can't sleep tonight work harder tomorrow.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"Usual Frame: I can't get to sleep. Reframe: I didn't work hard enough."&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read a bunch of books in 2022... here's what I learned from them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;You can either control the algorithm or be controlled by it.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"You either tell robots what to do, or are told by robots what to do; you live either above the algorithm, or below it."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Louise Perry (The Case Against the Sexual Revolution)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Sure, a forklift can lift more weight but that's not the point.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"'Oh my God, AIs can beat humans, what do we do about this?' I really think, 'It doesn't fucking matter.' I'm a rock climber, and AI being able to beat me at Go matters as much as a helicopter being able to beat me at a rock climb."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Oliver Roeder (Seven Games)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;There's a lot of unpublished research out there...&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"The public sees only the research that scientists decide to publish, not the projects that fail, that remain unfinished, or that they choose to keep secret."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Alina Chan (Viral)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;The best art persuades us of something.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"Many works of art are trying to persuade us of something rather than just pleasing us."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Alain de Botton (How to Think More Effectively)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Don't let what you don't have get in the way of what you do.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"The more important task of life is to recognize what you do not have while being grateful for what you do."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Douglas Murray (The War on the West)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;A choice isn't (necessarily) a mistake.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"Life choices that turn out differently from what we hoped aren't mistakes. They're just choices that turned out differently than we hoped."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Russ Roberts (Wild Problems)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;There's no luck in the long run.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"In the long run, there is no luck. In the short run, there is nothing but."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Oliver Roeder (Seven Games)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Be careful "Plan B" doesn't turn into "Plan A".&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"People who have something to fall back on usually end up falling back on it."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Rich Cohen (The Adventures of Herbie Cohen)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Pay more attention to your thoughts.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"The genius doesn't have different kinds of thoughts from the rest of us, they simply take them more seriously."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Alain de Botton (How to Think More Effectively)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;You can change what you want, to become what you want.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"We are in the process of becoming. So give some thought as to what you desire to desire."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Russ Roberts (Wild Problems)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Virtue is just the cumulative sum of virtuous actions.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"Virtue comes about, not by a process of nature, but by habituation... We become just by doing just actions, temperate by doing temperate actions, brave by doing brave actions."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Michael Schur (How to be Perfect)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Independence isn't permanent.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"Modern contraception has allowed us to stretch out that young adult stage artificially, giving the illusion that independence is our permanent state. But it isn't—it's nothing more than a blip, which some of us will never experience at all."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;—Louise Perry (The Case Against the Sexual Revolution)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Take more pictures of friends and less pictures of things.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"Once, when I returned from a vacation with pictures of beautiful landscapes, he scolded me, saying, 'Where are the people? The faces? In ten years, it's not that geyser you'll want to see. It's the faces of your friends.'"&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Rich Cohen (The Adventures of Herbie Cohen)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Let them prove you wrong.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"I implied that the skills needed for advanced bowyery were beyond them. They resolved to show me how wrong I was. Perfect."&lt;/i&gt;

  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— KJ Parker (A Practical Guide to Conquering the World)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Look inwards when trying to figure out what others want.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"When trying to work out what others want to eat, or what they might like to hear, or why they may be upset, the best move is to put our own ego into the picture, to imagine that our experience is relevant and that, despite the beard or different skin colour or gender or degree of wealth or geographical origins, what we're faced with is someone who is, first and foremost, a human like us."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Alain de Botton (How to Think More Effectively)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;People just want what other people want.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"We don't want the things we want because we judge them to be good, we want them because other people want them."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Max Chafkin (The Contrarian)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Sameness—not difference—is the cause of conflict.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"Remember that conflict is caused by sameness, not by difference. If everything is equally good or important, the propensity for conflict is higher."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Siblings really are naturally rivalrous...&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"'Do you know the data on siblings across species?'" he asked, before I was even half done. I didn't. 'Oh, yeah,' he said. 'Half the time they kill each other.'"&lt;/i&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;All she needs is a runway.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"Women do not need to be changed, adjusted, domesticated, moulded, formed, or coddled. We need space and a runway."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Marie Henein (Nothing But the Truth)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;If you don't know, the answer is "No".&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"If you feel like you've got a close call between quitting and persevering, it's likely that quitting is the better choice."&lt;/i&gt;

  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Annie Duke (Quit)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Good interrupting is often good listening. &lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;""The good listener (paradoxically) is a skilled interrupter. But they don't interrupt to intrude their own ideas; they interrupt to help the other get back to their original, more sincere, yet elusive concerns."&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;p class="right"&gt;— Alain de Botton (How to Think More Effectively)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Who, not what, you know.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"[Things you'll] need to make it in the modern world: guile, greed, charm, and a deep appreciation that what you know is less important than who you know."&lt;/i&gt;

  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"What are the most powerful words in a negotiation? Are they 'I'm an expert. I know better?' No. They're 'Who?', 'Huh?' and 'Wha?' When it comes to negotiating, you'd be better off acting like you know less, not more. In some cases, dumb is smarter than smart, and inarticulate is better than articulate. You want to train yourself to say, 'I don't know' … 'You lost me' … 'Could you repeat that?' The most powerful words in business are 'I don't understand. Help me.'"&lt;/i&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Learning "when" is often more important than learning “how".&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"Schools teach how. We learn to copy what works with the emphasis always on the how and not the when. I learned how to construct complicated mathematical models, but never learned when presenting such a model was inappropriate. I learned to reason logically, but never learned when logic might offend someone. I learned contract law, but never learned when to just shake hands. Learning when to do something is far more difficult than learning how to do that same thing, if only because we must always learn how first."&lt;/i&gt;

  &lt;summary&gt;Better to avoid "the worst" than aim for “the best”.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"Most darts players aim for the treble 20, because that’s what the professionals do. However, for all but the best darts players this is a mistake: if you are not very good, your best approach is not to aim at treble 20 at all, but instead to aim at the south-west quadrant of the board, towards treble 19 and 16. You won’t get 180 that way, but nor will you score 3. It is a common mistake in darts to assume that you should simply aim for the highest possible score – you should also consider the consequences if you miss. Many real-life decisions have a scoring rubric that is more like darts than archery."&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there was Daughter Rule Number Seven to consider: don’t have opinions over boyfriends unless expressly asked, and then – well, play it safe and sit on the fence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't let a pandemic get in your way&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s true. We don’t choose our circumstances. We will have to fall in love when we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="right"&gt;— Charles Yu, &lt;i&gt;Interior Chinatown&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plagues are a feature of the human experience. What happened in 2020 was not new to our species. It was just new to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why the days blurred together this year&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greater our acquaintance with the routines of everyday life, the quicker we perceive time to pass, and generally, as we age, this familiarity increases. This theory suggests that, to make our time last longer, we should fill our lives with new and varied experiences, eschewing the time-sapping routine of the everyday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="right"&gt;— Kit Yates, &lt;i&gt;The Math of Life and Death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the next time you hear someone say "exponential"&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folks toss around “exponential” as a synonym for “very fast,” but its technical meaning is something more wonderful and precise: when a thing’s growth is proportional to its size. In other words: the bigger the object, the faster it grows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="right"&gt;— Ben Orlin, &lt;i&gt;Change Is the Only Constant&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power law distributions are surprisngly everywhere&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preferential attachment model helps explain why the distributions of links on the World Wide Web, city sizes, firm sizes, book sales, and academic citations are power laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="right"&gt;— Scott Page, &lt;i&gt;The Model Thinker&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We need both&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big-coefficient thinking widens roads and builds high-occupancy vehicle lanes to reduce traffic. New-reality thinking builds train and bus systems. Big-coefficient thinking subsidizes computers for low-income students. New-reality thinking gives everyone a computer and reduces mail delivery to three days a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="right"&gt;— Scott Page, &lt;i&gt;The Model Thinker&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to predict with the Copernican method&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gott’s prediction method does not factor in playwright, stars, casts, or reviews; nor does it consider advance ticket sales, celebrity buzz, advertising campaigns, or what people are willing to pay or do to score a ticket. He nonetheless found that how long a show had already run was a better predictor of its future run than much informed opinion is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="right"&gt;— William Poundstone, &lt;i&gt;The Doomsday Calculation&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In /r/wallstreetbets world it's important to remember&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stock is a machine for producing earnings. Were you buying an apartment building as an investment, you’d ask how much rent it was producing. You would want to buy as much rental income as possible for your money. Corporate earnings are the stock market’s rent. Any dividends will be paid out of those earnings. Earnings not paid out may be reinvested in the company, increasing the value of shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="right"&gt;— William Poundstone, &lt;i&gt;Rock Breaks Scissors&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Markets are neat&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This planet happens to harbor delicious fruit spheres called “apples.” How should we allocate them? If farmers grow more than consumers want, we’ll find piles of Red Delicious rotting in the streets. If consumers want more than farmers grow, we’ll witness strangers clawing at one another to snag the last McIntosh during a shortage. Yet somehow, against all odds, we manage to grow just about the right number of apples. The trick? Prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="right"&gt;— Ben Orlin, &lt;i&gt;Math with Bad Drawings&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Throwing money at a problem rarely fixes the problem&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any one-time influx of money, regardless of its size, will dissipate in its effect unless it changes transition probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="right"&gt;— Scott Page, &lt;i&gt;The Model Thinker&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Money as freedom from money&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because that’s what money gives you: the freedom to stop thinking about money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="right"&gt;— Emily St. John Mandel, &lt;i&gt;The Glass Hotel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes your money can do more good than you can&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you donate money to a cause, you effectively transform your own labor into additional work for that cause. If you are more suited to your existing job and the cause is constrained by lack of funding, then donating could even help more than direct work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't rush to settle &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; your debts&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is good fiscal policy may be bad amorous policy —  for part of love is to fall into debt and yet tolerate the uncertainty arising from owing someone something, trusting them with the ensuing power, the choice it gives them of how and when to claim their dues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="right"&gt;— Alain de Botton, &lt;i&gt;The Romantic Movement&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing well is the trap. A different kind, but still a trap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things work out in the end, and if they don’t, you won’t be in much of a position to complain anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire transport sector, including trains, planes, ships, trucks, and cars, accounts for 25 percent of the country’s energy use, while the heating and cooling of buildings through air conditioning accounts for nearly 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anthropomorphized Rabbit POV&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driving cars and talking and having TV was kind of fun, and clothes and eating out totally rock. But the hate, the fear, the greed. It just doesn’t make any sense. You’re trying to run a twenty-first-century world on Palaeolithic thoughts and sentiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why we hate each other&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s utility in keeping us divided. As people, the more separate we are, the more politically impotent we become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I like creativity, truth, and progress&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Censorship kills creativity, truth, and progress in obvious ways. Without the free exchange of ideas, people can’t share risky new ideas (creativity), test them against other people’s logic and facts (truth), or compile them into civilizational advances (progress).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It might just be good because &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; is small&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formula for the standard deviation of the mean implies that large populations have much lower standard deviations than small ones. From this, we can infer that we should see more good things and more bad things in small populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not all masculinity is toxic&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men’s behavior is, to some extent, the result of female sexual preferences. If women didn’t want to mate with masculine men, these traits would have been removed from the gene pool long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Girard’s theory of mimetic desire holds that people have no idea what they want, or what they value, so they are drawn to what other people want. They want what other people have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is tempting to quote authors when they express our very own thoughts but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we cannot match. They know us better than we know ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As time goes on, you'll understand. What lasts, lasts; what doesn't, doesn't. Time solves most things. And what time can't solve, you have to solve yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember, as a kid, when I first understood that only half of every tree is visible, that the roots in the soil are equal to the branches in the sky, that a whole other half is underground. It took me a lot longer, well into adulthood, to realize people are like that too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not always possible to restore one's boundaries after they have been blurred and made permeable by a relationship: try as we might, we cannot reconstitute ourselves as the autonomous beings we previously imagined ourselves to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emotionally intelligent person knows that love is a skill, not a feeling, and will require trust, vulnerability, generosity, humour, sexual understanding and selective resignation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Things to be mindful of in this &lt;code&gt;present&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being properly mature involves a frank, unfrightened relationship with one’s own darkness, complexity and ambition. It involves accepting that not everything that makes us happy will please others or be honoured as especially ‘nice’, but it can be important to explore and hold on to it nevertheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—The School of Life in &lt;em&gt;An Emotional Education&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to come face-to-face with the past, not as some naive, easily wounded boy, but as a grown-up, independent professional. Not to see what you want to see, but what you must see. Otherwise, you’ll carry around that baggage for the rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Haruki Murakami in &lt;em&gt;Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four things do not come back: the spoken word, the sped arrow, the past life, and the neglected opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Ted Chiang in &lt;em&gt;Exhalation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s terrifying when you consider that every thought we have, every choice we could possibly make, branches into a new world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Blake Crouch in &lt;em&gt;Dark Matter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know everything feels hopeless to you in this moment, but this is just a moment, and moments pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—Blake Crouch in &lt;em&gt;Recursion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To calm us down in noisy streets, we should trust that those making a noise know nothing of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Alain de Botton in &lt;em&gt;The Consolations of Philosophy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brain collects up all the information from the senses before it decides upon a story of what happens. The strange consequence of all this is that you live in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Annaka Harris in &lt;em&gt;Conscious&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If something exciting happens, the gut instinct of Facebook users is to pull out their smartphones, take a picture, post it online, and wait for the ‘likes’. In the process they barely notice what they themselves feel. Indeed, what they feel is increasingly determined by the online reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Yuval Noah Harari in &lt;em&gt;21 Lessons for the 21st Century&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, saying that you don't care about privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different from saying you don't care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Edward Snowden in &lt;em&gt;Permanent Record&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privacy is the ability to make our own choices without fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Roger McNamee in &lt;em&gt;Zucked&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man who works for the immediate present and its immediate rewards is nothing but a fool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—David McCullough in &lt;em&gt;The Wright Brothers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our positive opportunities in life often matter more than the amount of cash in our bank accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Tyler Cowen in &lt;em&gt;Stubborn Attachments&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is wrong to punish, demean or look down on people for characteristics over which they have no control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Douglas Murray in &lt;em&gt;The Madness of Crowds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to life is to care, but not that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Rich Cohen in &lt;em&gt;The Last Pirate of New York&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the overcompensations for misery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Aldous Huxley in &lt;em&gt;Brave New World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness is the joy you find on hundreds of forgettable Wednesdays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Sheryl Sandberg in &lt;em&gt;Option B&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Things to remember for the &lt;code&gt;future&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is like reading a novel or running a marathon. It’s not so much about reaching a goal but rather about the journey itself and the experiences along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Edward O. Thorp in &lt;em&gt;A Man for All Markets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future is less a noun than a verb, a thing we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Douglas Rushkoff in &lt;em&gt;Team Human&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a common theme in human progress. We make things beyond what we understand, and we always have done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Matt Parker in &lt;em&gt;Humble Pi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you invent a new technology you also invent the accident of that technology. When you invent the car, you also invent the car accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Elan Mastai in &lt;em&gt;All Our Wrong Todays&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must learn that technology’s problems can’t always be solved with more technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Douglas Rushkoff in &lt;em&gt;Team Human&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a place for our past in our future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Christine Finn in &lt;em&gt;The Last Unknowns&lt;/em&gt; edited by John Brockman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think anyone is sane you just don’t know enough about them. The key — and this is very relevant in our case — is to find someone whose insanity dovetails with your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Christopher Moore in &lt;em&gt;The Stupidest Angel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two people should see a relationship as a constant opportunity to improve and be improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—The School of Life in &lt;em&gt;An Emotional Education&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turn not thine eyes, but love the one thou’rt with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Ian Doescher as William Shakespeare in &lt;em&gt;Get Thee Back to the Future!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cause none of us is just the numbers on the back of our baseball cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Rich Cohen in &lt;em&gt;The Chicago Cubs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always believed that you have to train harder than you play. That's how you win—so that the match, when it comes, comes as a kind of break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Maria Sharapova in &lt;em&gt;Unstoppable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how vivid they were in life, no matter how brilliant, no matter the wonders they made, they came to dust and smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Madeline Miller in &lt;em&gt;Circe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want power, at some point you will have to spread fictions. If you want to know the truth about the world, at some point you will have to renounce power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Yuval Noah Harari in &lt;em&gt;21 Lessons for the 21st Century&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing about knowledge and power is that there’s always more of both to be had and each increases the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Jeffery Russell in &lt;em&gt;The Dungeoneers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire world is built on the work of some fool too dumb to put his name on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Rich Cohen in &lt;em&gt;Sweet and Low&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not clear why a generation which can’t accumulate capital should have any great love of capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Douglas Murray in &lt;em&gt;The Madness of Crowds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might quickly find ourselves about as important to the algorithms as animals currently are to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Niall Ferguson in &lt;em&gt;The Square and the Tower&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube, Twitter and Facebook have made it explicitly clear which opinions you are allowed to have. If you don’t want to be censored, don’t say the wrong things. It really is that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Titania McGrath in &lt;em&gt;Woke&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;For the next &lt;code&gt;52&lt;/code&gt; books&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He soon came to learn that books were not the solution in entirety. They were about life, but they were not life itself, and he closed them up and put them away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Patrick deWitt in &lt;em&gt;French Exit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2019 00:00:00 -0000</pubDate><guid>https://maxhumber.com/quotes2019</guid></item><item><title>Quotes 2018</title><link>https://maxhumber.com/quotes2018</link><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading is as creative a process as writing, sometimes more so. When we read of the dying rays of the setting sun or the boom and swish of the incoming tide, we should reserve as much praise for ourselves as for the author. After all, the reader is doing all the work - the writer might have died long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Jasper Fforde in First Among Sequels&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;#life&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an impossibly complex world, we should perhaps shun temporary stability and instead be willing to tolerate a bit of volatility in order to find a greater stability thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Emanuel Derman in This Idea Is Brilliant edited by John Brockman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always expect a kick in the teeth, so that when you get a slap in the chops, it seems like a triumph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Jasper Fforde in The Woman Who Died a Lot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you say yes when no needs to be said, you transform yourself into someone who can only say yes, even when it is very clearly time to say no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Jordan Peterson in 12 Rules for Life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the point of making predictions if they cannot change anything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Yuval Noah Harari in Homo Deus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to imagine your best decision in the last year. Now take a moment to imagine your worst decision. I’m willing to bet that your best decision preceded a good result and the worst decision preceded a bad result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Annie Duke in Thinking in Bets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should never sacrifice what you could be for what you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Jordan Peterson in 12 Rules for Life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve got to be bad before you can be good at anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Rich Cohen in Monsters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to contribute to a brand-new environment is not by trying to prove what a wonderful addition you are. It’s by trying to have a neutral impact, to observe and learn from those who are already there, and to pitch in with the grunt work wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Chris Hadfield in An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s one thing to see something and another thing to do something with it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Jerry Seinfeld in Seinfeldia by Jennifer Armstrong&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s our market share? Don’t know, don’t care. It’s irrelevant. Do we have enough customers paying us enough money to cover our costs and generate a profit? Yes. Is that number increasing every year? Yes. That’s good enough for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Jason Fried in It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always present your ideas in the context of alternatives that are clearly worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Scott Adams in Win Bigly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you actually want to make progress, you have to narrow as you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Jason Fried in It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe working on the little things as dutifully and honestly as we can is how we stay sane when the world is falling apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Haruki Murakami in Men Without Women&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not always a light at the end of the tunnel. That is why you must carry a torch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—J. Zachary Pike in Son of a Liche&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To honour every one of our emotions would be to annul any chance of leading a coherent life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Alain de Botton in How to Think More About Sex&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything comes to an end. A good bottle of wine, a summer’s day, a long-running sitcom, one’s life, and eventually our species. The question for many of us is not that everything will come to an end but when. And can we do anything vaguely useful until it does?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Jasper Fforde in The Woman Who Died a Lot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;#love&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s when you know it’s over. As soon as you start thinking about the beginning, it’s the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Junot Diaz in This Is How You Lose Her&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can’t decide whom we are going to be turned on by any more than we can will a certain flavour of ice cream or style of painting to be our favourite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Alain de Botton in How to Think More About Sex&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spend a bit of time playing the field when you’re young, rejecting everyone you meet as serious life-partner material until you’ve got a feel for the marketplace. Then, once that phase has passed, pick the next person that comes along who’s better than everyone you met before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Hannah Fry in The Mathematics of Love&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you put yourself out there, start at the top of the list and work your way down, you’ll always end up with the best possible person who’ll have you. If you sit around and wait for people to talk to you, you’ll end up with the least bad person who approaches you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Hannah Fry in The Mathematics of Love&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is one of the ironies of love that it is easiest confidently to seduce those we are least attracted to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Alain de Botton in On Love&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most attractive are not those who allow us to kiss them at once (we soon feel ungrateful) or those who never allow us to kiss them (we soon forget them), but those who know how to carefully administer varied doses of hope and despair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Alain de Botton in On Love&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classically beautiful women should be left to men without imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Alain de Botton in On Love&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been out with lots of woman who are much prettier than her, better built, with better taste, and more intelligent. But those comparisons are meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Haruki Murakami in Men Without Women&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mistake was to confuse a destiny to love with a destiny to love a given person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Alain de Botton in On Love&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would it really be possible to trust anyone who never showed any interest at all in being unfaithful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Alain de Botton in How to Think More About Sex&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is erotic that isn’t also, with the wrong person, revolting, which is precisely what makes erotic moments so intense: at the precise juncture where disgust could be at its height, we find only welcome and permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Alain de Botton in How to Think More About Sex&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be so much less to do without sex. No one would bother to open jewellery stores, embroider lace, serve food on silver platters or hoist hotel rooms onto pontoons over tropical lagoons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Alain de Botton in How to Think More About Sex&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need both art and sex to make us whole, so it is not surprising if the mechanisms of compensation should be similar in each case. The specifics of what we find ‘beautiful’ and what we find ‘sexy’ are indications of what we most deeply crave in order to rebalance ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Alain de Botton in How to Think More About Sex&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;#reflection&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to fix the world—a handyman’s dream, if ever there was one—is to fix yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Jordan Peterson in 12 Rules for Life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s not the world that’s at fault. Maybe it’s you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Jordan Peterson in 12 Rules for Life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re all something we’re not. Every one of us is stuck between the person we want to be and the person we can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Jasper Fforde in Early Riser&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all aspire to be ourselves, an original character in a litany of fiction so vast that we know we cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Jasper Fforde in The Well of Lost Plots&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s good to realise that we aren’t as remarkable as we might imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Jonas Karlsson in The Room&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are social beings that begin to atrophy—even to physically decay—if they are denied regular contact with other humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—David Graeber in Bullshit Jobs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing to narrow reality into a single belief system, based solely on human experience, seems insane to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Jeremy Robinson in Infinite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can talk problems into existence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Alain de Botton in On Love&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;#truth&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every guy can basically be boiled down to what he wants and what he’s afraid of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Christopher Moore in Noir&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human life is a process by which we, as humans, create one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—David Graeber in Bullshit Jobs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are times in this world when it's not enough just not to do the wrong thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Haruki Murakami in Men Without Women&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many wars might not have started if someone had first asked, “We lost. How?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Richard Thaler in This Idea Is Brilliant edited by John Brockman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everyone agreed to suffer pain or death rather than be treated unjustly, greedy people could never again gain power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Michael Poore in Reincarnation Blues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we accumulate more data and increase our computing power, events become wilder and more unexpected. The more we know, the less we can predict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Yuval Noah Harari in Homo Deus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clarke’s Second Law of Egodynamics: For every expert there is an equal and opposite expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Jasper Fforde in One of Our Thursdays Is Missing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as a panel of hairdressers is likely to recommend that you change your hairstyle, a panel of surgeons is likely to recommend surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Chris Hadfield in An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supply has far outpaced demand in most industries, so now it is demand that is manufactured. My job is a combination of manufacturing demand and then exaggerating the usefulness of the products sold to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—David Graeber in Bullshit Jobs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies don’t exist to make happy employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Patty McCord in Powerful&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you reach an audience of many, you must first reach an audience of one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Jeff Goins in Real Artists Don't Starve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been suspicious of game changers. Sometimes the game doesn’t need changing – or no one has a clear idea of which game will be changed, and for what and how much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Jasper Fforde in Early Riser&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friendships nourished solely by occasional dinners will never have the depth of those forged on a trek or at a university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Alain de Botton in On Love&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;#2019&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the real world were a book, it would never find a publisher. Overlong, detailed to the point of distraction-and ultimately, without a major resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Jasper Fforde in Something Rotten&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 29 Dec 2018 00:00:00 -0000</pubDate><guid>https://maxhumber.com/quotes2018</guid></item><item><title>Quotes 2017</title><link>https://maxhumber.com/quotes2017</link><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more choices there are, the more you expect to find a perfect fit; yet, at the same time, the larger the array, the less likely it becomes that you picked the best item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Jonathan Haidt in The Happiness Hypothesis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Level: micro&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're always you, and that don't change, and you're always changing, and there's nothing you can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Neil Gaiman in The Graveyard Book&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we don’t know what we want, we’re unlikely to get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Max Tegmark in Life 3.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A picture’s beauty does not depend on the things portrayed in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Alain de Botton in How Proust Can Change Your Life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's like the people who believe they'll be happy if they go and live somewhere else, but who learn it doesn't work that way. Wherever you go, you take yourself with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Neil Gaiman in The Graveyard Book&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience is what you get when you didn’t get what you wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Randy Pausch in The Last Lecture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are not regularly deeply embarrassed by who we are, the journey to self-knowledge hasn’t begun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Alain de Botton in The Course of Love&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about money not as an end in itself but as a means for self-improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Geoffrey Miller in Mate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path to happiness in a relationship is not just about finding someone who you think is going to make you happy. Rather, the reverse is equally true: the path to happiness is about finding someone who you want to make happy, someone whose happiness is worth devoting yourself to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Clayton Christensen in How Will You Measure Your Life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more be griev'd at that which thou hast done: Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud: Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun, And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud. All men make faults, and even I in this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— William Shakespeare in Sonnets, 35&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I free to change my mind? Of course not. It can only change me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Sam Harris in The Moral Landscape&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mud huts, penthouses and the Champs-Elysées don’t really determine our mood. Serotonin does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Yuval Noah Harari in Sapiens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our dissatisfactions may be the result of failing to look properly at our lives rather than the result of anything inherently deficient about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Alain de Botton in How Proust Can Change Your Life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can calculate the motions of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Isaac Newton in Fortune's Formula by William Poundstone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personalities are not a single immutable color, like white or blue, but rather illuminated screens, and the shades we reflect depend much on what is around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Mohsin Hamid in Exit West&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best lies to tell are the ones people want to believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Jasper Fforde in Shades of Grey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activities connect us to others; objects often separate us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Jonathan Haidt in The Happiness Hypothesis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An injection of jealousy is the only thing capable of rescuing a relationship ruined by habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Alain de Botton in How Proust Can Change Your Life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women know what they want when they’ve got it, and men know what they want when it’s gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Duana Welch in Love Factually&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women marry believing that their husbands will change. Men marry believing that their wives will not change. They are both wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— David Buss in The Evolution of Desire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve got to find the right person. And you have to be the right person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Duana Welch in Love Factually&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would help us pay more attention to things, lovers in particular. Deprivation quickly drives us into a process of appreciation, which is not to say that we have to be deprived in order to appreciate things, but rather that we should learn a lesson from what we naturally do when we lack something, and apply it to conditions where we don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Alain de Botton in How Proust Can Change Your Life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final moment of success is often no more thrilling than the relief of taking off a heavy backpack at the end of a long hike. If you went on the hike only to feel that pleasure, you are a fool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Jonathan Haidt in The Happiness Hypothesis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love: the sickest of Irony’s sick jokes. The place where logic and order go to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Christopher Moore in Coyote Blue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness is good for the body, but it is grief which develops the strengths of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hell is other people. But so is heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a thing I believe about people my age: we are the children of Hogwarts, and more than anything, we just want to be sorted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Robin Sloan in Sourdough&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are wired to need other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Duana Welch in Love Factually&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I look back on my own life, I recognize that some of the greatest gifts I received from my parents stemmed not from what they did for me—but rather from what they didn’t do for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Clayton Christensen in How Will You Measure Your Life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to understand the world, one has to turn away from it on occasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Albert Camus in We Need to Talk by Celeste Headlee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success in America doesn't require any special talent or any kind of extra effort. You just have to be consistent and not fuck up. That's how most people fail. They can't stand the pressure of getting what they want, so when they see that they are getting close they engineer some sort of fuckup to undermine their success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Christopher Moore in Island of the Sequined Love Nun&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the freewheeling days of school and university are over, company and warmth become dispiritingly hard to find; social life starts to revolve oppressively around couples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Alain de Botton in The Course of Love&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re fine with people who don’t look like us, as long as they think like us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Milo Yiannopoulos in Dangerous&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much literature and drama would conceivably have proved entirely unengaging, would have said nothing to us had we first encountered its subject matter over breakfast in the form of a news-in-brief. "Tragic end for Verona lovebirds: after mistakenly thinking his sweetheart dead, a young man took his life. Having discovered the fate of her lover, the woman killed herself in turn."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Alain de Botton in How Proust Can Change Your Life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we love, we always strive to become better than we are. When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Paulo Coelho in The Alchemist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our understanding of love has been hijacked and beguiled by its first distractingly moving moments. We have allowed our love stories to end way too early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Alain de Botton in The Course of Love&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing like doing something wrong to spur other people into doing it correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it’s in the news, don’t worry about it. The very definition of news is ‘something that hardly ever happens.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— David G. Myers in Know This by John Brockman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoyable as it might be while it lasts, it probably goes without saying that the life of a mere consumer lacks any real meaning and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas religion asks us to believe in something, money asks us to believe that other people believe in something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active investing is a zero-sum game. The only way for one active investor to do better than average is for another active investor to do worse than average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— William Poundstone in Fortune's Formula&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern business-people and lawyers are, in fact, powerful sorcerers. The principal difference between them and tribal shamans is that modern lawyers tell far stranger tales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will embarrass our descendants, just as our ancestors embarrass us. This is moral progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— Sam Harris in The Moral Landscape&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A culture and a society are not things run for the convenience of the people who happen to be here right now, but a deep pact between the dead, the living and those yet to be born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Douglas Murray in The Strange Death of Europe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without appropriation, culture as we know it would not exist. Civilization would resemble a Nickelback album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving a superintelligence a single open-ended goal with no constraints can therefore be dangerous: if we create a superintelligence whose only goal is to play the game Go as well as possible, the rational thing for it to do is to rearrange our Solar System into a gigantic computer without regard for its previous inhabitants and then start settling our cosmos on a quest for more computational power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything that every individual has ever done in all of human history and prehistory establishes the minimum boundary of the possible. The maximum, if any, is completely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ninety-five percent of all the species that have ever existed are now extinct, so don’t look so goddamn smug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes a museum great is the stuff that's not on the walls. Someone says no. A curator is involved, making conscious decisions about what should stay and what should go. There's an editing process. There's a lot more stuff off the walls than on the walls. The best is a sub-sub-subset of all the possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having two thousand ducats isn't twice as good as having one thousand; it is less than twice as good, because a thousand ducats is worth less to a person who already has a thousand ducats than it is to the person who has none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Maynard Keynes, once said that successful investing is anticipating the anticipations of others. For a share of stock to be sold at, say, $60, the buyer must believe he can sell it later for $70 to someone who believes he can sell it for $80 to someone who believes he can sell it for $90 to someone who believes he can sell it for $100 to someone else. In this way, the value of a stock isn't what people think it's worth but what people think people think it's worth. In fact, even that's not going far enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A survey by the Tippie College of Business at the University of Iowa found that firms that shelled out for CSR did better than others during downturns, because, the authors speculated, their clients were more loyal and less likely to abandon them when money was tight. But others argue that the causation may work the other way: firms that are stable and successful are more likely than wobbly ones to have spare cash to lavish on nonessential projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of things get better as they get shorter. Directors cut good scenes to make a great movie. Musicians drop good tracks to make a great album. Writers eliminate good pages to make a great book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were applying for your dream job, you would never sign a contract that said, 'I not only promise never to leave this job, but I promise to be equally enthusiastic about working here for the rest of my life, no matter how this job evolves and no matter how much I change as a person.' Yet this is more or less what most of us do when we get married.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the not-throwing-sand-and-not-shoving-people competition, I get the participant ribbon.

&lt;p&gt;The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why and Where phases.

&lt;p&gt;Voters aren't stupid or delusional. Each voter has a perfectly rational, coherent political stance. But in the aggregate, their position is nonsensical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe individual people seem irrational because they aren't really individuals! Each one of us is a little nation-state, doing our best to settle disputes and broker compromises between the squabbling voices that drive us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undecided voters, by and large, aren't undecided because they're carefully weighing the merits of each candidate, unprejudiced by political dogma. They're undecided because they're barely paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously. It was designed to make you want it. If people had turned out not to want it very much, the makers would have redesigned it and redesigned it until they did. The world is now full of things like this, which is, of course, why everybody is in such a permanent state of want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Douglas Adams in &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2hit6uz"&gt;The Salmon of Doubt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societies in which even your deepest beliefs and feelings can be questioned and trodden upon are the only societies worth living in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A frightened nation is a nation that buys evening papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Jonas Jonasson in &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2hmkmoQ"&gt;Hitman Anders and the Meaning of It All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music is still being made, of course. The best bands are as proficient as ever. The best songs still rock. But the underlying belief is gone. No one thinks music will change the world, or wants it to. It's like a lot of religion. People fill the churches, though less out of fear and trembling than out of habit. We do it because our parents did it. We do it because it's what we've always done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Rich Cohen in &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2iosBkj"&gt;The Sun &amp;amp; the Moon &amp;amp; the Rolling Stones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forget universities! They're irrelevant. They've become businesses and not even good ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Tom McCarthy in &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2iov2n2"&gt;Satin Island&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's odd to spend time in the company of somebody with power—I mean real, executive power: to hang out with a powerful person. You would imagine they exude this power at every turn, with each one of their gestures; that their very bodies sweat the stuff, wafting its odour at you through expensive clothes. But in fact, the thing most noticeable about this Minister was her lack of powerful aura. She seemed very normal. She wasn't physically striking in any way: neither particularly tall nor particularly short; neither fat nor thin; neither attractive nor ugly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;On Statistics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to predict how long something will last, and have no other knowledge about it whatsoever, the best guess we can make is that it will continue just as long as it's gone on so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the forecast said there was a 70% chance of rain and it rains, people think the forecast was right; if it doesn't rain, they think it was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are billions of planets where there is no life, but there's no one on those planets with brains to notice. It's like if everyone in the world was tossing coins eventually someone would get 5,698 heads in a row and they would think they were very special. But they wouldn't be because there would be millions of people who didn't get 5,698 heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;On Work and Talent&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't be afraid to show your flaws. Imperfections are real and people respond to real. It's why we like real flowers that wilt, not perfect plastic ones that never change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— Jason Fried &amp;amp; DHH in &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2iqEMZN"&gt;Rework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep down, every human being wants to find meaning in his or her work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Laszlo Bock in &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2iqHMW5"&gt;Work Rules!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who are learning and growing most quickly and those performing at the highest level, the one way to make sure your pay is in line with the value you create is to leave the monopolistic internal market and enter the free market. That is, look for a new job, negotiate based on what you are truly worth, then leave. And that's exactly what you see in the labor market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Laszlo Bock in &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2iqHMW5"&gt;Work Rules!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual performance scales linearly. Teaching scales geometrically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Laszlo Bock in &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2iqHMW5"&gt;Work Rules!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do, and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Philip Tetlock in &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2hiq611"&gt;Superforecasting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time a new piece of work comes in, divide its importance by the amount of time it will take to complete. If that figure is higher than for the task you're currently doing, switch to the new one; otherwise stick with the current task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Brian Christian &amp;amp; Tom Griffiths in &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2iosnJJ"&gt;Algorithms to Live By&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Brian Christian &amp;amp; Tom Griffiths in &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2iosnJJ"&gt;Algorithms to Live By&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workaholics miss the point. They try to fix problems by throwing sheer hours at them. They try to make up for intellectual laziness with brute force. This results in inelegant solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Jason Fried &amp;amp; DHH in &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2iqEMZN"&gt;Rework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest mistake leaders make is that they manage too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By law, no matter the substrate used to make it—grains or grapes or the classic potato—vodka is supposed to be nothing but water and ethanol; distillers can vary the ratio, but that's it. In other words, the standard bottle of vodka is just 750 milliliters of H2O and C2H6O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Adam Rogers in &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2hTbAxs"&gt;Proof: The Science of Booze&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;In Closing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to be pleasant to one another, get plenty of fresh air, read a good book now and then, depose your government when it suspends the free press, try to use the mechanism of the state to adjudicate fairly, and employ diplomatic means wherever possible to avoid armed conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should never pass up an opportunity to be kind. You should never not thank someone. You should never not say something nice when you think it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing about keeping notebooks is that you have to revisit them in order to make the most out of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Austin Kleon in Show Your Work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;On Business&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frogs get better and better at catching flies, while flies get better and better at escaping frogs. Each has to run as hard as it can to stay in the same place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— John Gribbin in Deep Simplicity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to advance a private interest, turn it into a public cause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Rich Cohen in The Fish That Ate the Whale&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no such thing as a regional hit. Only a global hit, waiting to be marketed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Stephen Witt in How Music Got Free&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Peter Principle: people keep getting promoted until they reach their level of incompetence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Richard Thaler in Misbehaving&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the rise and fall of BlackBerry teaches us anything it is that the race for innovation has no finish line, and that winners and losers can change places in an instant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Jacquie McNish in Losing the Signal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for progress explains why so many companies have invented titles and intermediate positions for management types. In a gamification-like approach companies want their employees to feel that they are making progress and moving ahead even when these steps are not very meaningful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Dan Ariely in Irrationally Yours&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine two financial analysts, Tom and Jerry, are playing a round of golf. Tom mentions that he is thinking of buying 100 shares of Apple. Jerry says, that’s convenient, I was thinking of selling 100 shares. I could sell my shares to you and avoid the commission to my broker. Before they can agree on a deal, both think better of it. Tom realizes that Jerry is a smart guy, so asks himself, why is he selling? Jerry is thinking the same about Tom, so they call off the trade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Richard Thaler in Misbehaving&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things MBAs learn in business school is to think like an Econ, but they also forget what it is like to think like a Human. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Richard Thaler in Misbehaving&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;On Love&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to despise the bar scene. I had experienced every single version of those nights. I knew all the possible outcomes, and I knew the probabilities of those outcomes. Statistically, the smartest thing for you to do when you walk into a bar is go to the bathroom, jerk off, and leave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Aziz Ansari in Modern Romance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participating in novel and exciting activities increases our attraction to people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Aziz Ansari in Modern Romance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mate value matters less than unique value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Aziz Ansari in Modern Romance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I’ve really been in love with someone, it’s not because they looked a certain way or liked a certain TV show or a certain cuisine. It’s more because when I watched a certain TV show or ate a certain cuisine with them, it was the most fun thing ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Aziz Ansari in Modern Romance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever you’re with is a reflection of you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Kanye West in TWAK&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often fail to appreciate what we have until we have lost it. We crave experiences, objects, relationships, only to grow bored with them. And yet the craving persists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Sam Harris in Waking Up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;On Economics(ish)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economists pretend they’re studying a social science, and while the economy is a machine of hugely complex systems, it’s also organic, the whole a reflection of the cells that make it up, a god made in our image, prone to flights of euphoric greed and pride, choking envy, irrational fear, pettiness, stinginess, manic euphoria and senseless depression. And…guilt. Embarrassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Jess Walter in The Financial Lives of the Poets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually allowed myself to believe that a person could own a piece of the world when the truth is that anything you try to own ends up owning you. We’re all just renting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Jess Walter in The Financial Lives of the Poets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of times, I feel like a lot of people are just rapping because it’s free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Kanye West in TWAK&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If music piracy was the ’90s equivalent of experimentation with illegal drugs, then Apple had invented the vaporizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Stephen Witt in How Music Got Free&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vladimir Lenin said that the purpose of terrorism is to terrorize. This is more insightful than it might seem: terrorists are not purely seeking to maximize their body count; instead, they want to maximize the amount of fear they inflict on a population so as to alter its behaviour in some way. Death and destruction are just a means toward that end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Nate Silver in The Signal and the Noise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is available to us, but that may be the problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Aziz Ansari in Modern Romance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;On Politics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man of system thinks he can move human beings with the same ease as the human hand can move the pieces on a chessboard. The problem is that the man of system ignores the rules of chess. He places the pieces here and there around the board as he sees fit, ignoring their natural motions given by the rules of the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Russ Roberts in How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boundaries between true intellectual disciplines are currently enforced by little more than university budgets and architecture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Sam Harris in Waking Up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great liberal betrayal of this generation is that in the name of liberalism, communal rights have been prioritized over individual autonomy within minority groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Sam Harris in Islam and the Future of Tolerance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politics is not where life happens. Legislation and government actions affect our lives in all kinds of ways, good and bad, but we have much to do outside that world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Russ Roberts in How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politicians are merely vessels for the ideas you fill them with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Daniel Schulman in Sons of Wichita&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power is all about what you don’t have to worry about, don’t have to know about, and don’t have to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— David Graeber in The Utopia of Rules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the best way for policy makers to make the world a better place is to leave it alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Russ Roberts in How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;On Religion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desire is suffering. A simple equation, and a nice catchphrase. But flipped around, it is more troubling: suffering is desire. Not a unidirectional arrow, not causal, as in, desire leads to suffering. Desire is suffering, and therefore, by axiom, suffering is desire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Charles Yu in How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My view is that no idea is above scrutiny, and no people are beneath dignity. As Ali A. Rizvi points out, if I say smoking is bad, this does not mean that I believe all smokers to be bad people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Sam Harris in Islam and the Future of Tolerance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the problems with religion is that it creates in-group loyalty and out-group hostility, even when members of one’s own group are behaving like psychopaths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Sam Harris in Islam and the Future of Tolerance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is indeed something preposterous about well-educated Westerners racing East in search of spiritual enlightenment while Easterners make the opposite pilgrimage seeking education and economic opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Sam Harris in Waking Up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;On Consciousness&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything we do is for the purpose of altering consciousness. We form friendships so that we can feel love and avoid loneliness. We eat specific foods to enjoy their fleeting presence on our tongues. We read for the pleasure of thinking another person’s thoughts. Every waking moment — and even in our dreams — we struggle to direct the flow of sensation, emotion, and cognition toward states of consciousness that we value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Sam Harris in Waking Up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the normal course of events, your mind will determine the quality of your life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Sam Harris in Waking Up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are governed, our minds molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Rich Cohen in The Fish That Ate the Whale&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we need to become happier and to make the world a better place is not more pious illusions but a clearer understanding of the way things are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Sam Harris in Waking Up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we have adapted to our environment, we tend to ignore it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Richard Thaler in Misbehaving&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything that one can experience on a drug is, at some level, an expression of the brain’s potential. Hence, whatever one has seen or felt after ingesting LSD is likely to have been seen or felt by someone, somewhere, without it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Sam Harris in Waking Up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;On Advice&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy a diversified portfolio heavily tilted toward stocks, especially if you are young, and then scrupulously avoid reading anything in the newspaper aside from the sports section. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Richard Thaler in Misbehaving&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who isn’t embarrassed of who they were last year probably isn’t learning enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Alain de Botton in Show Your Work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as self-help books spouting idealism are best avoided, people so doing should be given wide berths too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Mohsin Hamid in How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we judge ourselves by what is hardest for us, we may take for granted those things that we do easily and routinely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Nate Silver in The Signal and the Noise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to make the world a better place, work on being trustworthy, and honour those who are trustworthy. Be a good friend and surround yourself with worthy friends. Don’t gossip. Resist the joke that might hurt someone’s feelings even when it’s clever. And try not to laugh when your friend tells you that clever joke at someone’s expense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Russ Roberts in How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of pursuing attention via wealth or fame or power, pursue wisdom and goodness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Russ Roberts in How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;On Being Human&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the biography of any ‘self-made’ man, and you will find that his success was entirely dependent on background conditions that he did not make and of which he was merely the beneficiary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Sam Harris in Free Will&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody looks like what they really are on the inside. You don’t. I don’t. People are much more complicated than that. It’s true of everybody. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Neil Gaiman in The Ocean at the End of the Lane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our flawed neighbours are the mirror that allows us to see our own imperfections and ideally to remedy them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Russ Roberts in How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People love books, more perhaps than they love the written word. They use them as a way to define who they are and to provide physical evidence of their values. Books on shelves and on tables are a kind of internal marketing exercise, reminding us who we are and who we want to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Mark Miodownik in Stuff Matters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great thing about homo sapiens is that we’ve got a brain that can override our instincts. If we want it to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Graeme Simsion in The Rosie Effect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all refugees from our childhoods. And so we turn, among other things, to stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Mohsin Hamid in How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Other&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concrete is literally the foundation of our whole society: it is the basis of our cities, our roads, our bridges, our power stations — it is 50 percent of everything we make. But like bone we prefer it on the inside; when it sticks out we are repulsed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Mark Miodownik in Stuff Matters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worry is a box to live inside of, a mechanism for evading the present, for re-creating the past, for dealing with the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
