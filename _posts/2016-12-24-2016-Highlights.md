My 52 favourite quotes for 2016:

'What makes a museum great is the stuff that's not on the walls. Someone says no. A curator is involved, making conscious decisions about what should stay and what should go. There's an editing process. There's a lot more stuff off the walls than on the walls. The best is a sub-sub-subset of all the possibilities.' — Jason Fried & DHH in [Rework](http://amzn.to/2iqEMZN)

'Having two thousand ducats isn't twice as good as having one thousand; it is less than twice as good, because a thousand ducats is worth less to a person who already has a thousand ducats than it is to the person who has none.' — Jordan Ellenberg in [How Not to Be Wrong](http://amzn.to/2iojAaT)

'John Maynard Keynes, once said that successful investing is anticipating the anticipations of others. For a share of stock to be sold at, say, $60, the buyer must believe he can sell it later for $70 to someone who believes he can sell it for $80 to someone who believes he can sell it for $90 to someone who believes he can sell it for $100 to someone else. In this way, the value of a stock isn't what people think it's worth but what people think people think it's worth. In fact, even that's not going far enough.' — Brian Christian & Tom Griffiths in [Algorithms to Live By](http://amzn.to/2iosnJJ)

'A survey by the Tippie College of Business at the University of Iowa found that firms that shelled out for CSR did better than others during downturns, because, the authors speculated, their clients were more loyal and less likely to abandon them when money was tight.

'Constraints are advantages in disguise.' — Jason Fried & DHH in [Rework](http://amzn.to/2iqEMZN)

' — Douglas Adams in [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](http://amzn.to/2hTnEid)

No one thinks music will change the world, or wants it to. It's like a lot of religion. People fill the churches, though less out of fear and trembling than out of habit.

You would imagine they exude this power at every turn, with each one of their gestures; that their very bodies sweat the stuff, wafting its odour at you through expensive clothes. But in fact, the thing most noticeable about this Minister was her lack of powerful aura. She seemed very normal.
