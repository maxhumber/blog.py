  <p>mummify just earned it's <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mummify/1.0/">v1.0</a> release!</p>

<p>It's kind of scary to kick software out of 0.x and label it "production ready". But after using it for a year, it feels ready... </p>

<p>I started writing mummify in early 2018 and debuted it at AnacondaCON that year, in a talk titled <a href="https://github.com/maxhumber/presentations/tree/master/2018-04-09_data_engineering">'Data Engineering for Data Scientists'</a>. Though the presentation was mostly tongue-in-cheek (I was saying shit like, "You suck at git. And logging. But it's not your fault") it seemed to be well received. </p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/mummify_slides.png" width="500" align="middle"></p>

<p><sup>Actual slides (lol)</sup></p>

<p>Since, I've used mummify in several machine learning projects and have heard from several more people who use it regularly.</p>

<p>What is mummify? </p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/maxhumber/mummify">mummify is git + logging for ML</a>.</p>

<p>The package automagically takes care of git and logging for your machine learning project so that you can focus on what's important.</p>

<p>I created mummify because I noticed that 80% of the work in Data Science doesn't actually work. Sure, you might try a bunch of things, pull on a couple of threads, build a few prototypes... but most of what you try, or pull on, or build, simply doesn't work (and won't ever work). </p>

<p>The 20% that does work, though? It more than pays for the 80% doesn't. </p>

<p>This reality—the reality of work in Data Science—is best captured in the Edison quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>mummify is that Edison quote, just wrapped in python. An audit log (that you don't have to write) that you can show your boss. Of all the things you tried. That didn't work. </p>

<p>I hope you'll give it a try!</p>
