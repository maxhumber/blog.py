 <summary>A life without problems (to solve) is meaningless.</summary>
  <br>
  <i>"The state of having no problems is obviously never going to arrive. And more to the point, you wouldn't want it to, because a life devoid of all problems would contain nothing worth doing, and would therefore be meaningless."</i>

 <summary>It's surprisingly easy to create problems when trying to solve problems.</summary>
  <br>
  <i>"I'm more interested in questions like, When you make progress against an individual problem do you create additional problems? What are those additional problems, and are those new problems bigger, the same as, or less than the problems you've just solved?"</i>

 <summary>Some problems become even worse when you try to eliminate them.</summary>
  <br>
  <i>"What's easy to miss is that there are bad things that become bigger problems when you try to eliminate them. I think the most successful people recognize when a certain amount of acceptance beats purity."</i>

 <summary>Your job is to reduce stress.</summary>
  <br>
  <i>"This is one of the most valuable reframes in the book. Usual Frame: Stress comes with the job. Reframe: Reducing stress IS your job. We work for a variety of reasons, but work is only one part of a larger system for reducing stress. I don't earn money just to have it. I earn money to make my life more pleasant, which includes reducing my stress about surviving."</i>

 <summary>You gotta tolerate some bullshit if you want to get ahead.</summary>
  <br>
  <i>"A unique skill, an underrated skill, is identifying the optimal amount of hassle and nonsense you should put up with to get ahead while getting along. Franklin Roosevelt—the most powerful man in the world, whose paralysis meant his aides often had to carry him to the bathroom—once said, 'If you can't use your legs and they bring you milk when you wanted orange juice, you learn to say 'that's all right,' and drink it.' Every industry and career is different, but there's universal value in accepting hassle when reality demands it."</i>

 <summary>It's okay to strategically underachieve.</summary>
  <br>
  <i>"You'll inevitably end up underachieving at something, simply because your time and energy are finite. But the great benefit of strategic underachievement—that is, nominating in advance whole areas of life in which you won't expect excellence of yourself—is that you focus that time and energy more effectively."</i>

 <summary>Stay on the fucking bus.</summary>
  <br>
  <i>"The final principle is that, more often than not, originality lies on the far side of unoriginality. The Finnish American photographer Arno Minkkinen dramatizes this deep truth about the power of patience with a parable about Helsinki's main bus station. There are two dozen platforms there, he explains, with several different bus lines departing from each one—and for the first part of its journey, each bus leaving from any given platform takes the same route through the city as all the others, making identical stops. Think of each stop as representing one year of your career, Minkkinen advises photography students. You pick an artistic direction—perhaps you start working on platinum studies of nudes—and you begin to accumulate a portfolio of work. Three years (or bus stops) later, you proudly present it to the owner of a gallery. But you're dismayed to be told that your pictures aren't as original as you thought, because they look like knockoffs of the work of the photographer Irving Penn; Penn's bus, it turns out, had been on the same route as yours. Annoyed at yourself for having wasted three years following somebody else's path, you jump off that bus, hail a taxi, and return to where you started at the bus station. This time, you board a different bus, choosing a different genre of photography in which to specialize. But a few stops later, the same thing happens: you're informed that your new body of work seems derivative, too. Back you go to the bus station. But the pattern keeps on repeating: nothing you produce ever gets recognized as being truly your own. What's the solution? 'It's simple,' Minkkinen says. 'Stay on the bus. Stay on the fucking bus.' A little farther out on their journeys through the city, Helsinki's bus routes diverge, plunging off to unique destinations as they head through the suburbs and into the countryside beyond. That's where the distinctive work begins. But it begins at all only for those who can muster the patience to immerse themselves in the earlier stage—the trial-and-error phase of copying others, learning new skills, and accumulating experience."</i>

  <br>
  <i>"'Rightfully so, rightfully so. Thus, from that we can conclude even if it were only minimally worse, there would be no reason to use the second-best search engine. Winner takes it all. Loser gets nothing. In the digital economy, nobody needs the second-best product, the second-best provider, the second-best social network, the second-best shop, the second-best comedian, the second-best singer. It's a superstar economy. Long live the superstar, fuck the rest.'"</i>

 <summary>Don't neglect risk by omission.</summary>
  <br>
  <i>"'Aunt Minnie has died and left each of you $100,000. You have an investment choice to make. You can invest it all at 7 percent for five years, or you can invest it at 7.5 percent for ten years.' After they had time to reflect, they unanimously chose 7 percent for five years. When I asked them what risk they'd undertaken with this decision, they said, 'None.' Their justification was that by staying short, future inflation wouldn't erode their returns as much as the longer term, and they'd have optionality after the five years. But they were missing the reinvestment risk. They were so focused on what would happen during the investment period, they neglected to look beyond the five years. Not a problem if rates stayed at 7 percent or higher. But if they dropped? Problem. Once the [MBA] students understood there is risk by omission as well as by commission, my objective was accomplished."</i>
