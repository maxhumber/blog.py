Another year, another 52 books! Overall, 2024 was a so-so year in reading for me—a couple good books and a bunch of bad ones (my average rating on Goodreads was a [3.3](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2024/16626766)). The new Robin Sloan release was especially disappointing and has kinda put me off his entire back catalog. Here's what I might recommend reading instead:

### Favourite Books of 2024

- [*The Courage to Be Disliked*](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1668069539) by Ichiro Kishimi
- [*Unruly: The Ridiculous History of England's Kings and Queens*](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/0593728483) by David Mitchell
- [*Red Side Story*](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1641296283) by Jasper Fforde
- [*Venomous Lumpsucker*](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1473613574) by Ned Beauman
- [*You Can Negotiate Anything*](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/0806541229) by Herb Cohen

### Dog Books

My wife and I welcomed a new puppy into our lives earlier this year. To prepare, I read seven different "dog" books, and I think she read another five? There's a mountain of wildly conflicting advice out there, but Steve Mann's [*Easy Peasy Puppy Squeezy*](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1788701607) and [*Easy Peasy Doggy Squeezy*](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1788703413) helped a lot.

### 52x10 
This year marks the 10th time that I've hit 52 books (or more). I think it might be time to start rereading some? Starting with a few favourites from 2015:

- [*How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia*](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1594632332) by Mohsin Hamid
- [*Waking Up*](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1451636024) by Sam Harris
- [*Flatland*](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B074J77XWL) by Edwin A. Abbott
- [*The Fish That Ate the Whale*](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0071VOLN8) by Rich Cohen
- [*How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life*](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00INIXQA2) by Russ Roberts

Really curious and excited to see how I'll feel about them a decade later...

### How I Read So Much
People always ask how I read so much... honestly, it's not *that* hard: no phones in bed and about 45–60 minutes of reading each night. Sure, I "cheat" with some audio books on Libby (about 10-15 per year), but there's a lot of evidence to suggest that [listening is just as good as reading](https://time.com/5388681/audiobooks-reading-books/). 

### Challenge Habits

Keeping up with the 52-challenge for a decade now has definitely forced some *interesting* habits. On the one hand, I'll ditch books earlier than most. On the other, I often force myself to slog through a garbage book because I'm too deep and need it for the count. Also, I tend to avoid books over 350 pages. And to maintain momentum, I usually juggle 2-3 books at a time (once I’m 90% done one, I’ll start the next).

### Quote Ritual

Every year I collect about 1000 highlights from my Kindle. It's become something of a ritual to export these quotes, manually go through each in a system of multiple passes, curate the best, and paraphrase the remainder into ideas that I hope to remember into the next year.
