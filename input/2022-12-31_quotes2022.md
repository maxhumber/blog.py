  <summary>In negotiations "dumb" is often better than "smart".</summary>

  <summary>You should go long civilization (because the short bet won't ever pay out).</summary>

  <summary>Good writing is good editing.</summary>
  <br/>
  <i>"When science fiction author Orson Scott Card teaches creative writing, he has the students give one another feedback on their drafts. But instead of grading the students based on their final essays, he grades them on the quality of the feedback they gave their classmates. His insight was that becoming a great writer requires becoming a great editor—learning to revise is essential to writing well."</i>
