> Imagine two financial analysts, Tom and Jerry, are playing a round of golf. Tom mentions that he is thinking of buying 100 shares of Apple. Jerry says, that’s convenient, I was thinking of selling 100 shares. I could sell my shares to you and avoid the commission to my broker. Before they can agree on a deal, both think better of it. Tom realizes that Jerry is a smart guy, so asks himself, why is he selling? Jerry is thinking the same about Tom, so they call off the trade.

#### On Love

> I started to despise the bar scene. I had experienced every single version of those nights. I knew all the possible outcomes, and I knew the probabilities of those outcomes. Statistically, the smartest thing for you to do when you walk into a bar is go to the bathroom, jerk off, and leave. 

— Aziz Ansari in Modern Romance

— Aziz Ansari in Modern Romance

> Whoever you’re with is a reflection of you.

#### On Economics(ish)

> Economists pretend they’re studying a social science, and while the economy is a machine of hugely complex systems, it’s also organic, the whole a reflection of the cells that make it up, a god made in our image, prone to flights of euphoric greed and pride, choking envy, irrational fear, pettiness, stinginess, manic euphoria and senseless depression. And…guilt. Embarrassment.

Death and destruction are just a means toward that end. 

— Nate Silver in The Signal and the Noise

> The world is available to us, but that may be the problem. 

— Aziz Ansari in Modern Romance

#### On Politics

> The man of system thinks he can move human beings with the same ease as the human hand can move the pieces on a chessboard. The problem is that the man of system ignores the rules of chess. He places the pieces here and there around the board as he sees fit, ignoring their natural motions given by the rules of the game.

#### On Religion

> Desire is suffering. A simple equation, and a nice catchphrase. But flipped around, it is more troubling: suffering is desire. Not a unidirectional arrow, not causal, as in, desire leads to suffering. Desire is suffering, and therefore, by axiom, suffering is desire. 

— Charles Yu in How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe

> There is indeed something preposterous about well-educated Westerners racing East in search of spiritual enlightenment while Easterners make the opposite pilgrimage seeking education and economic opportunities. 

— Sam Harris in Waking Up

#### On Consciousness

> Everything we do is for the purpose of altering consciousness. We form friendships so that we can feel love and avoid loneliness. We eat specific foods to enjoy their fleeting presence on our tongues. We read for the pleasure of thinking another person’s thoughts. Every waking moment — and even in our dreams — we struggle to direct the flow of sensation, emotion, and cognition toward states of consciousness that we value. 

— Sam Harris in Waking Up

> During the normal course of events, your mind will determine the quality of your life.

> When we have adapted to our environment, we tend to ignore it. 

— Richard Thaler in Misbehaving

> Everything that one can experience on a drug is, at some level, an expression of the brain’s potential. Hence, whatever one has seen or felt after ingesting LSD is likely to have been seen or felt by someone, somewhere, without it. 

— Sam Harris in Waking Up

> If we judge ourselves by what is hardest for us, we may take for granted those things that we do easily and routinely. 

— Nate Silver in The Signal and the Noise

> If you want to make the world a better place, work on being trustworthy, and honour those who are trustworthy. Be a good friend and surround yourself with worthy friends. Don’t gossip. Resist the joke that might hurt someone’s feelings even when it’s clever. And try not to laugh when your friend tells you that clever joke at someone’s expense. 

— Russ Roberts in How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life

> Instead of pursuing attention via wealth or fame or power, pursue wisdom and goodness.

> Nobody looks like what they really are on the inside. You don’t. I don’t. People are much more complicated than that. It’s true of everybody. 

— Neil Gaiman in The Ocean at the End of the Lane

> Our flawed neighbours are the mirror that allows us to see our own imperfections and ideally to remedy them. 

— Russ Roberts in How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life

> People love books, more perhaps than they love the written word. They use them as a way to define who they are and to provide physical evidence of their values. Books on shelves and on tables are a kind of internal marketing exercise, reminding us who we are and who we want to be.

— Mohsin Hamid in How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia

#### Other

> Concrete is literally the foundation of our whole society: it is the basis of our cities, our roads, our bridges, our power stations — it is 50 percent of everything we make. But like bone we prefer it on the inside; when it sticks out we are repulsed. 

— Mark Miodownik in Stuff Matters

> Worry is a box to live inside of, a mechanism for evading the present, for re-creating the past, for dealing with the future. 

— Charles Yu in How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe
